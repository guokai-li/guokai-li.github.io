I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student at CUHK-Shenzhen, where I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Zizhuo Wang](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangzizhuo/) and [Prof. Pin Gao](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/gaopin).

I highly value and actively pursue research that is practical or insightful to industries:

* Methodologies: LP-based online algorithm, approximate dynamic programming;

* Topics: revenue management, OM-marketing interface, sustainable operations.
